# AuthApi  

An API for user authentication and authorization built with **ASP.NET Core**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **ASP.NET Core Identity**. The project provides a foundation for managing user authentication, role-based access control, and JWT token issuance.

## Features  
- User registration and login.  
- JWT token generation and validation for secure API access.  
- Role-based access control.  
- Extendable user and role models for custom attributes.  
- Clean Architecture design pattern for scalability and maintainability.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:  
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)  
- [Docker]([https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads](https://www.docker.com/))

## Project Structure  

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with the following layers:  

- **API**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.  
- **Application**: Contains business logic and service implementations.  
- **Domain**: Contains core entities and interfaces.  
- **Infrastructure**: Handles data persistence and third-party integrations.

## API Endpoints  

### Authentication  
- **POST /api/auth/register**  
  Register a new user.  
  **Request body:**  
  ```json  
  {  
    "email": "user@example.com",  
    "password": "YourStrongPassword123!",  
    "confirmPassword": "YourStrongPassword123!"  
  }  
  ```  

- **POST /api/auth/login**  
  Authenticate a user and return a JWT token.  
  **Request body:**  
  ```json  
  {  
    "email": "user@example.com",  
    "password": "YourStrongPassword123!"  
  }  
  ```  

### Roles  
- **GET /api/auth/roles**  
  Retrieve the roles assigned to the authenticated user.

## Security  

- Passwords are hashed using **ASP.NET Core Identity**'s default algorithms.  
- JWT tokens are used for stateless authentication and have configurable expiration.  
- Follow best practices for storing the JWT secret in environment variables or secure stores like Azure Key Vault.
